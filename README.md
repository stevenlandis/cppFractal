# Fractal Generator (in c++)

This repository has a bunch of classes to generate fractals and save the designs to .bmp images.

This code is mainly for my personal use so it isn't too well commented. Good luck.

You can start with `main.cpp` as a starting point for what can be done. Running `make` should make an image called `out.bmp`.
